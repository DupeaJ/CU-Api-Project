# RandomRecipe.com

## Description

RandomRecipe.com serves individuals who are new to cooking at home (and maybe a bit indecisive), and who are looking for a place to begin their cooking journey. With an interactive and engaging experience, our web app generates a random food and cocktail recipe for users based on their selected preferences.

This web app is a sinlge page application powered by JavaScript that uses two APIs (MealDB and CocktailDB) to generate random food and drink recipes and display them using HTML and CSS.

-   Motivation: There are countless cooking blogs out there. But often, people who are learning how to cook don’t even know where to start! RandomRecipe.com is the solution. We created this web app to inspire people who are new to cooking and give them a place to start.

-   Challenges: Our biggest challenge was conceptualizing the user experience. We had so many ideas for features to bring complexity to the UX. Since we were limited on time, we had to narrow down to just a few to start with, and build from there.
